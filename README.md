 Mooer Multieffects Guitar Plugin Converter - GE200 to GE150
 The PHP code was created by https://gist.github.com/sonnm which he posted in a gist at https://gist.github.com/sonnm/a6378d2a4776edb5b1ede1dd3f1a29bb
 I cloned his gist and created a repository at Github so that i could beautify and create a simple user experience utilizing his code and a bootstrap template starter.
 I had recently purchased a GE150 and stumbled upon the GE200 plugin converter code and it seems to work when i imported it into my GE150! Thanks Son Nguyen!
 A functional webpage exists at http://uxredesigner.com/mooer.php where the tool can be used.
 No guarantees. Use at your own risk. But it did work for me.
